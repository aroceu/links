<h1>about</h1>

<p><i>If you degrade hyperlinks, and you degrade this idea of the internet as something that refers you to other things, you instead have this stationary internet where a generative AI agent will hoover up and summarize all the information that’s out there, and place it right in front of you so that you never have to leave the portal…</i></p>

<p>This is a gathered collection of links I have bookmarked, saved, returned to, or planned on checking out, over the many years I have been on the internet. It is by no means comprehensive or necessarily representative of my knowledge, enjoyment, or experience with the topic at hand, just links I considered worth saving at one point in time. These have been amassed from: my Pinboard, Delicious, Diigo, Tumblr, and personal bookmarks&mdash;I find them all worth sharing here for one reason or another.</p>

<p>Though link sharing seems to be a lost art in the modern age, I am here to revive it! I hope that through these pages you find at least <i>one</i> new idea, article, or website to explore. If I can do that, then I've achieved my goal.</p>

<p>While some sections may have certain creators or pieces of entertainment recommended, this is by no means intended to be a recommendations list. If you'd like only things I'd recommend, check out my <a href="https://aroceu.com/library" target="blank">library</a>.</p>

<p>You can keep up with real time updates and <a href="https://github.com/aroceu/links" target="_blank">view a repository of this project on Github</a>.

<h3>a few caveats</h3>

<p>Even with the thoroughness of this site, I generally try to avoid linking to:</p>

<ul><li>Websites that require you to log in/have an account to reliably view a webpage, such as Twitter/X</li>
    <li>Websites prone to linkrot due to likely username changes and no easy redirect method, such as Tumblr</li>
    <li>Anything behind a paywall</li>
    <li>Known predatory abusers or conspiracy theorists who I do not wish refer anyone else to <small><i>(this, of course, is subject to my own knowledge and comfort, but I state this more to indicate that I am sharing these links with some level of consciousness and responsibility)</i></small></li>
    <li>Websites or ideas that are not reliably accessible in some way</li>
    <li>Websites that are not in English, due to my own language restrictions</li>
</ul>

<p>I also try to research and fact-check before sharing things. Though I have not meticulously researched <i>everything</i> linked here, all links have come from channels that are reliable to me in some way.</p> 

<p>I have also linked many things here to be taken into intellectual consideration, not necessarily to endorse its information, rhetoric, or accuracy. Your mileage may vary with those as well.</p>

<h3>if there's something missing...</h3>

<p>You can hit me up on any of my <a href="https://aroceu.com" target="blank">socials/contactable areas</a> if there's a link you'd like to recommend to me. Better yet, though, you can have your own assortment of links, and then I can link your links here as well. Either way, I'm a huge purveyor of link-sharing and would greatly encourage others to do the same :)</p>
