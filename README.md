# links @ kingdra.net
Simultaneously a passion project and out of my own convenience, my "links" page is a collection of, well, links that I've collected over the years. They're an assortment of bookmarks from a bunch of other ways I used to save links, before I decided that a public archive would not only be useful to me, but others as well, because I know I'm quite resourceful.

Links on this page are categorized by topic and/or necessity; some links show up more than once because they may appear in one than more category. I tried to make a lot of the organization intuitive, because if no one else I know that *I* will forget where I put a certain link, so having it logically accessible will solve that for use cases in the future.

The passion project aspect is based on my ideas of digital archiving&mdash;but you can visit the site if you want to learn more about that :)

# notes
There will be no changelog for this site because I'm adding to it regularly across a variety of categories at a time; though I think archiving changes is fun, I don't want to go too crazy with it. Still, you can see the changes as they occur in this repository's updates.

The design is intentionally simple to keep the focus on the dense collections of links.
